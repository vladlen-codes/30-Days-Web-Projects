## What Is This?

This is a **30-day challenge** where I build one insane, visually stunning web UI project every day — from magnetic cursors to AI-powered tools to CSS-only games. Every project is:

- **Educational** — real concepts, real code, explained clearly
- **Visual** — built to look incredible and stop the scroll
- **Minimal** — no bloated frameworks, mostly Vanilla JS + CSS
- **Reel-ready** — each one documented as an Instagram Reel

## Concepts Covered

Over 30 days, this series touches on a wide range of real frontend skills:

**JavaScript**
- `requestAnimationFrame` and animation loops
- Canvas API and particle systems
- Linear interpolation (Lerp) and easing
- Drag API and pointer events
- TensorFlow.js and in-browser AI

**CSS**
- 3D transforms and `perspective`
- `mix-blend-mode` and filter effects
- CSS-only interactivity with `:has()` and checkboxes
- Scroll-driven animations
- Custom properties and dynamic theming

**Creative Coding**
- Physics simulation (magnetic pull, gravity, bounce)
- Procedural particle systems
- SVG path manipulation
- WebGL basics

---

## Getting Started

No installs. No build tools. Just clone and open.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/30-days-insane-webdev.git
cd 30-days-insane-webdev

# Open any day
open day-01-magnetic-cursor/index.html
```

Every project is a single `index.html` file — open it in any modern browser and it works instantly.
