## ✨ What I Built

A **magnetic cursor effect** where UI elements get physically attracted to your cursor as it moves nearby — built from scratch with zero libraries. Just pure math and `requestAnimationFrame`.

- 🧲 Buttons magnetically pull toward the cursor within a set radius
- 💜 Custom cursor with a lagging ring for a juicy, premium feel
- ✨ Particle trail that spawns glowing purple/magenta particles as you move
- 🤖 Idle demo loop — auto-animates when the user hasn't moved yet
- 📱 Styled as a phone frame (390×844px) — perfect for Instagram Reels

## 🧠 How It Works

### The Magnetic Effect

The core magic is a `Magnetic` class that calculates the distance between your cursor and a target element. If you're within the `radius`, it pushes the element toward you using linear interpolation (lerp).

```js
move(e) {
  const dx = px - x, dy = py - y;
  const dist = Math.hypot(dx, dy);

  if (dist < this.R) {
    const f = (this.R - dist) / this.R;   // falloff factor
    this.tx = dx * f * this.S;            // target X offset
    this.ty = dy * f * this.S;            // target Y offset
  }
}
```

### The Lerp Smoothing

One line makes it feel buttery smooth:

```js
this.cx += (this.tx - this.cx) * this.L;
```

`lerp(current, target, 0.12)` — the lower the last value, the more floaty and laggy the motion feels.

### Spawning a Magnetic Element

```js
new Magnetic(element, { radius: 120, strength: 0.6, lerp: 0.14 });
```

| Parameter  | Description                                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `radius`   | Distance in px before magnet activates                   |
| `strength` | How far the element moves (0–1)                          |
| `lerp`     | Smoothing factor — lower = floatier, higher = snappier   |

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- **`Math.hypot(dx, dy)`** — calculates distance between two points
- **`requestAnimationFrame`** — smooth 60fps animation loop
- **Linear Interpolation (Lerp)** — `a + (b - a) * t` for smooth easing
- **`getBoundingClientRect()`** — gets element position relative to viewport
- **`mix-blend-mode: difference`** — makes the cursor dot invert colors underneath

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- Dark `#07060f` background to make the purple glow pop
- Animated ambient orbs in the background add depth without distraction
- Grid overlay with a radial mask creates a subtle techy feel
- The cursor ring expands and changes color on hover — tiny detail, big impact
- Bottom bar shows `lerp(current, target, 0.12)` as a code snippet — educational and aesthetic

## 🚀 Try It Yourself

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser
3. Move your cursor near the buttons — feel the pull 🧲

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/30-days-insane-webdev.git
cd 30-days-insane-webdev/day-01-magnetic-cursor
open index.html
```

## 💡 Want to Experiment?

Try tweaking these values in the JS:

```js
// Super dramatic — big radius, strong pull, floaty
new Magnetic(btn, { radius: 200, strength: 0.9, lerp: 0.05 });

// Subtle and snappy
new Magnetic(btn, { radius: 60, strength: 0.3, lerp: 0.25 });

// Dreamy and slow
new Magnetic(btn, { radius: 150, strength: 0.5, lerp: 0.04 });
```
